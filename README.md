- We can also do token substitution while copying files.
- We can add the wrapper by executing the `gradle wrapper` command.
- `./gradlew --version` will show the version of Gradle being used.
- `./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=8.0` will update the wrapper to a specific version.
- `git rm -r --cached .gradle` to remove the `.gradle` directory from Git cache.
- `gradle projects` will list all the projects in the build.
- `gradle tasks` will list all the tasks available in the build. There are different groups of tasks. `Build Setup tasks`, `Help tasks`, etc.
- `generateDescriptions` and `zipDescriptions` are not part of any group. `gradle tasks --all` will show all tasks including those not in any group.
- We can run multiple tasks by separating them with a space, e.g., `gradle generateDescriptions zipDescriptions`.
- When we run `./gradlew`, it runs the `help` default task. We can customize this by specifying a different default task in the `build.gradle` file. `defaultTasks 'generateDescriptions'` will set `generateDescriptions` as the default task.
- We can also specify a part of the task name to run. For example, `gradle h` will run the `help` task. `gradle gD for generateDescriptions` will run the `generateDescriptions` task.
- command line arguments. 
- `gradle --help` which is different from `gradle help` will show the command line options available for Gradle.
- `gradle gD --info` will run the `generateDescriptions` task with additional logging information. `gradle --info gD` will also work.
- `--console` has different options like `plain`, `rich`, and `auto`. `--console=plain` will show the output in plain text without any formatting. `--console=rich` will show the output with colors and formatting. `--console=auto` will automatically choose the best option based on the terminal capabilities. `./gradlew gD --console=verbose`
